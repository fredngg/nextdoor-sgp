-- IMMEDIATE FIX: Add basic policies to all tables
-- This will make your app work instantly

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "allow_insert_communities" ON communities;
CREATE POLICY "allow_read_communities" ON communities FOR SELECT USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "allow_insert_communities" ON communities FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);

-- 3. posts - Public read, auth write

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "allow_write_posts" ON posts;
CREATE POLICY "allow_read_posts" ON posts FOR SELECT USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "allow_write_posts" ON posts FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

-- 4. comments - Public read, auth write

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "allow_write_members" ON community_members;
CREATE POLICY "allow_read_members" ON community_members FOR SELECT USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "allow_write_members" ON community_members FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

-- 6. user_profiles - Owner only
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "allow_own_profile" ON user_profiles;
CREATE POLICY "allow_own_profile" ON user_profiles FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- 7. votes - Auth only
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "allow_post_votes" ON post_votes;

CREATE POLICY "allow_post_votes" ON post_votes FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);
CREATE POLICY "allow_comment_votes" ON comment_votes FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

-- Verify policies were created
